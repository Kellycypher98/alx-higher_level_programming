## Project: JavaScript Web Scraping with Node.js and APIs

In this project, we explore JavaScript web scraping using Node.js along with the `request` module to interact with two different APIs: [Star Wars](https://swapi.co/) and [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

### Task 0: Readme

**0-readme.js:** This JavaScript script reads and prints the contents of a specified file. To use the script, run `./0-readme.js <file path>`.

### Task 1: Write me

**1-writeme.js:** With this JavaScript script, you can write a given string to a file. To use it, run `./1-writeme.js <file path> <string to write>`.

### Task 2: Status code

**2-statuscode.js:** This script performs a `GET` request to a provided URL using the `request` framework and displays the status code of the response. To use it, run `./2-statuscode.js <URL to GET>`. The output will be `code: <status code>`.

### Task 3: Star Wars movie title

**3-starwars_title.js:** By utilizing the Star Wars API, this script prints the title of the Star Wars movie corresponding to a given integer episode number. To use it, run `./3-starwars_title.js <episode number>`.

### Task 4: Star Wars Wedge Antilles

**4-starwars_count.js:** This script uses the Star Wars API to determine the number of movies featuring the character "Wedge Antilles". To use it, run `./4-starwars_count.js http://swapi.co/api/films/`.

### Task 5: Loripsum

**5-request_store.js:** The script fetches the contents of a webpage from a specified URL and stores it in a file. To use it, run `./5-request_store.js <URL to get> <file path to store content in>`.

### Task 6: How many completed?

**6-completed_tasks.js:** Using the JSONPlaceholder API, this script computes the number of completed tasks per user ID. To use it, run `./6-completed_tasks.js https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`.

### Task 7: Who was playing in this movie?

**100-starwars_characters.js:** With this script, you can find all the characters featured in a given Star Wars movie. To use it, run `./100-starwars_characters.js <movie ID>`.

### Task 8: Right order

**101-starwars_characters.js:** Similar to the previous script, this one lists all characters featured in a given movie using the Star Wars API. However, the characters are printed in the same order as they appear in the `characters` list of the `/films/` response. To use it, run `./101-starwars_characters.js <movie ID>`.

Enjoy exploring web scraping and interacting with APIs using JavaScript and Node.js! Happy coding!
